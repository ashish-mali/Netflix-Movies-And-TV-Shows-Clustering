## üìã Abstract

<p>This project aims to analyze the Netflix dataset of movies and TV shows till 2021 and group them into relevant clusters using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The developed content-based recommendation system, based on cosine similarity matrix, is expected to improve the user experience and reduce subscriber churn for Netflix, which currently has over 220 million subscribers. The project includes handling null values, nested columns, binning the rating attribute, performing EDA, creating clusters using various attributes, reducing dimensionality, and developing a recommender system. The findings provide valuable insights into trends in the rapidly growing world of streaming entertainment and help improve the user experience for subscribers..</p>

## üó∫Ô∏è Dataset Description

The dataset contains 7,787 records and 11 features, including information about movies and TV shows from 1925 to 2021. The dataset includes two types of content: movies (71.1%) and TV shows (28.3%). The most frequent rating is TV-MA (Mature Audience only) followed by Teen and older. The highest number of content was added in 2019. The highest number of content is available in the months of October, December, and January.

## üîé Key Findings

>* Most of the content is of the type of movie (71.1%).
>* The highest number of aquitted/created content was added in 2019.
>* The highest number of content is available in the months of October, December, and January.
>* The top genres where most of the movies and TV shows are listed are Dramas, International Movies, and Comedies.
>* The optimal number of clusters for the dataset is four.
